# useId Example

## Overview

`useId` is a React Hook that generates unique IDs that are stable across server and client renders. It's particularly useful for accessibility attributes that require unique IDs.

[Official Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId)

## What This Example Demonstrates

This app shows how `useId` generates unique IDs for accessibility attributes. The `PasswordField` component is rendered twice (for password and confirm password), and each instance gets its own unique ID generated by `useId`.

Without `useId`, if you hardcoded the same ID for both password fields, you would get:
- Console warnings about duplicate IDs
- Broken accessibility (screen readers wouldn't know which hint belongs to which field)

With `useId`, each `PasswordField` instance automatically gets a unique ID, ensuring proper accessibility and avoiding ID collisions, even when the component is used multiple times.

**Key Concepts:**
- Generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Avoiding ID collisions when reusing components
- Ensuring consistent IDs across server and client rendering
- Proper use of `aria-describedby` with generated IDs
