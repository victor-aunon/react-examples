A collection of practical examples demonstrating React 19 hooks and their use cases.

## Apps

- **[use-state](./apps/use-state)** - Managing component state and resetting it using the key prop
- **[use-effect](./apps/use-effect)** - Performing side effects in response to component lifecycle and state changes
- **[use-effect-event](./apps/use-effect-event)** - Accessing latest state values from effects without re-triggering them
- **[use-callback](./apps/use-callback)** - Memoizing functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders and effect triggers
- **[use-id](./apps/use-id)** - Generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes in server-side rendering
